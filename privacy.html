            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-brand">1. Data Collection & Usage</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">To provide a seamless fitness experience, SparkFit collects and processes the following information:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> We capture your <strong>email address</strong> to create your unique user profile. This allows us to sync your data across multiple devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Fitness Data:</strong> We process workout logs, awards earned, meal plans, and weight history to provide progress tracking and personalized coaching.</li>
                <li><strong>Marketing Communications:</strong> If you explicitly opt-in (by checking the marketing consent box), we will use your email address to send you fitness tips, product updates, and promotional offers. You can opt-out at any time via the "Unsubscribe" link in our emails.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="mb-10">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-brand">2. Cloud Syncing & Backups</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">SparkFit utilizes a "Your Data, Your Cloud" approach to ensure maximum privacy and security:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>iOS Users:</strong> Your fitness data and app settings are backed up and synced via <strong>Apple iCloud</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Android Users:</strong> Your data is backed up and synced via <strong>Google Drive</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Privacy Note:</strong> While we facilitate the sync, SparkFit does not host your fitness history on our own private servers. Your data remains within your personal cloud ecosystem, protected by your own Apple or Google security settings.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-10">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-brand">3. AI Processing</h2>
            <p>Our AI Coach uses encrypted channels to process your queries. While your fitness metrics may be used contextually to provide better advice, these interactions are anonymized during processing and are not sold to third-party advertisers.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-10">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-brand">4. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">We may use anonymized analytics tools (such as Google Play Console or Apple App Store Connect) to monitor app performance and crash reports. These tools do not identify you personally but help us fix bugs and improve the user experience.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-10">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4 text-brand">5. Data Retention & Deletion</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">We believe you should have total control over your information:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>App Deletion:</strong> If you delete the app without a cloud backup enabled, your local data is permanently erased.</li>
                <li><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> You may request the deletion of your account and the removal of your email from our marketing lists at any time through the app settings or by contacting support.</li>
                <li><strong>Cloud Data:</strong> You can manage or delete your SparkFit backup files directly within your iCloud or Google Drive storage settings.</li>
            </ul>
